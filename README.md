# Carolina Data Challenge Spotify Web API project
## Using the Spotify Web API to build the ultimate 2000s playlist

We used the Spotify web API to get information about Spotify's song attributes "danceability", "loudness", "energy", "valence" and "speechiness". We found the average of each of these attribute values for the top songs of the 2000s, and made a playlist of songs from the 2000s that had attribute values within 10% of the average.

In collaboration with Judson Greer, Queston Parker, and Gaines Diseker
